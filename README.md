This package provides users with a Python API and CLI to **publish observation messages** to SNEWS and **subscribe to receive alerts** from the SNEWS servers.

The SNEWS Publishing Tools are fully documented at [snews-publishing-tools.readthedocs.io](https://snews-publishing-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Before you begin:
* Ensure your hop credentials are set up!
* Follow the instructions in the [**Quick Start**](https://snews-publishing-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart.html) guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
## Fire Drills

We carry out regular multi-experiment fire drills to test the publishing tools. Fire drills are documented on [this page](https://snews-publishing-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/firedrills.html).

The `snews_pt` library uses fire-drill mode as its default option. If not desired, it can be disabled using the `firedrill_mode=True/False` arguments in the subscription and publication functions, or through the `--firedrill/--no-firedrill` flags within the CLI tools.

To publish and/or subscribe to the fire drill channels, please ensure you have the correct [hop permissions](https://my.hop.scimma.org/hopauth/).

## How to Install the SNEWS Publishing Tools

Detailed installation instructions are provided in our [Installation Guide](https://snews-publishing-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation.html).

We recommend that you install SNEWS the publishing tools PyPI package (`snews_pt`) using pip:
```
pip install snews_pt
```
To minimize conflicts with other Python packages, we suggest you set up a dedicated environment using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda), or another tool used to create isolated Python environments.

## How to Publish and Subscribe

### Publishing

A main purpose of this software is to publish messages to the SNEWS server for the formation of coincident alerts. The exact protocols and interface are described in our [Publishing Guide](https://snews-publishing-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/publishing_protocols.html). Please also see our paper on the publishing tools: [M. Kara et al., JINST 19:P10017, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17743).

### Subscribing

The `snews_pt` package provides easy "read-only" subscriptions to alert topics, and allows subscribers to receive alerts in real time. See the [Subscription Guide](https://snews-publishing-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subscribing.html) for detailed instructions.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

Tools for command line interactions with the `snews_pt` library are available, and are explained in our guide to the [CLI Tools](https://snews-publishing-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/command_line_interface.html).

## Remote Commands and More

The SNEWS server allows for several remote commands. Some of them are meant only for the developers of `snews_pt` and are not intended for regular users. However, there are a few useful functionalities that the user can exploit to test their connections to the SNEWS 2.0 coincidence server.

The available functions are detailed in our [Remote commands](https://snews-publishing-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/remote_commands.html) guide.
